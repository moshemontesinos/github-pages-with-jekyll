Welcome to MIT Golub Center's Infrastructure Toolkit!

**GCFP Infrastructure Finance initiative**  seeks to provide the financial techniques to help leaders in the public and private sectors to:

1. Make _informed decisions_ based on known financial principles when evaluating your public infrastructure deals, 
2. Effectively incorporate the _right price of risk_ in your valuations through adequate risk adjustments, and 
3. 	Learn how to utilize _advanced financial methods_ to include all features and claims that are usually present in infrastructure deals (e.g. Subsidies, Externalities, etc.)

Following [MIT's](mit.edu) lemma **"mens et manus"**, the present book is designed with a pragmatic approach. In each section, we will provide you not only the theory but also concrete examples of how this methods are used in the real world.
